# Review Python ICE
The purpose of this assignment is to review the basics of Python. As an ICE, you may work with other students in the class. You are still required to submit your own homework to GitHub.

To submit, please perform the following:
1. Perform your work in the Python file [reviewpythonice.py](reviewpythonice.py).
1. Provide solutions for the following tasks:
   1. Python Exercises: Variables (3 pts.)
   1. Python Exercises: Data Types (2 pts.)
   1. Python Exercises: Data Types 2 (2 pts.)
   1. Python Exercises: Iteration (3 pts.)
1. Push your assignment to GitHub.

### Python Exercises: Variables
Perform the following exercises using Python in the function `python_variables()`.
* Create a variable named `hometown` with the value of the town where you graduated highschool.
* Create a variable named `x` with a value of `298784`.
* Create two variables, `j` and `l`, with values, `5` and `10`, respectively.
* Create a variable named `z`. Assign it a value equal to the sum of `j` and `l`. Print out the result.
* Using a single line of code, assign the variables `t`, `q`, `r`, and `s` the value of `education` (keep in mind case sensitivity).

### Python Exercises: Data Types
Given the following in Python, identify the data types for each variable by printing the data type to the console. Perform your work in the function `data_types()`. When printing, use one `print()` function per variable.

```python
a = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
b = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
c = False
d = 'covid-19'
e = int(487)
```

### Python Exercises: Data Types 2
This is similar to the previous exercise, except you will use a single `print()` function to output the data types to the console. Use the new line character `\n` at the end of each line (except the last line). Provide your solution in the function `data_types2()`.

### Python Exercises: Iteration
You are given the following in python:

```python
lunches = ['burger','apple','soba','chahan']
```

Given the code above, complete the following tasks in the function `food_loop()`.
* Write a `for` loop to print each item.
* If the food is `soba` exit the loop immediately (you can use more than two lines).
